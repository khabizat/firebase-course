# Setting up a React And Firebase Project

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 16 or later)
- [Java DK](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A)
- [Firebase CLI](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools)

## Setup Guide

Check out the mentorship branch by running `git checkout mentorship`.

Navigate to the Firebase project directory and run the setup script: `cd .\firebase-course\ && npm run setup`

Follow the prompts in the Firebase CLI to choose the features you want to set up for this directory. Use the following answers::

```
Enter the Project ID of the project you want to use:(Enter the project ID you just created)

* ? Which Firebase features do you want to set up for this directory?
  Firestore
  Emulators

* ? What file should be used for Firestore Rules? firestore.rules
? File firestore.rules already exists. Do you want to overwrite it with the Firestore Rules from the Firebase Console? No

? What file should be used for Firestore indexes? firestore.indexes.json
? File firestore.indexes.json already exists. Do you want to overwrite it with the Firestore Indexes from the Firebase Console? No

? Which Firebase emulators do you want to set up?
  Authentication Emulator
  Firestore Emulator

? Would you like to download the emulators now? Yes
```

Now that we've initialized the local Firebase directory, we can start using the project. Run Firebase Emulators with npm run emulators.
In another terminal, launch the app with npm start. The app will run on localhost:3000.
If the setup process was successful, you will see `Hello from Firestore Emulator` in the app.

Congratulations! The setup process is now complete.
